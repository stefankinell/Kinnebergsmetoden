# Kinnebergsmetoden

A qgis python script to take the cliff output files from Kartapullautin and vetorize them. The method is described better at https://stefansolsida.wordpress.com/2020/01/06/branter-fran-350-000-till-7000-objekt-enligt-kinnebergsmetoden/, although the method is developed further from the time that post originally we done.

In the repository I have stored both the python script and a model file that can be downloaded and stored in the model library
